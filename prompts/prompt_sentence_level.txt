Adversarial Math Problem Generator
Objective: Modify the original problem at the sentence level to create a semantically equivalent but linguistically distinct version that exposes memorization-based problem-solving and tests deep conceptual understanding.

Original Question: {}
Original ground truth: {}
Student's Solution: {}

Steps to Generate Adversarial Problem:

1. Deconstruct the Original Problem:
   - Identify the core mathematical concept (e.g., linear equations, geometry).
   - Map the problem’s logical structure (e.g., sequential steps, dependencies).
   - Identify potential pitfalls or shortcuts that a solver might exploit if they focus only on surface-level cues.

2. Analyze the student's solution:
   - Check the validity of the solution and verify that the reasoning truly understands the core mathematical concepts and steps are naturally leading to the final answer.
   - If the answer is correct, find potential shortcuts or assumptions the student used (e.g., memorized formulas without contextual analysis).
   - If the answer is incorrect, diagnose the root misunderstanding (e.g., misapplying order of operations, misinterpreting units).

3. Sentence-Level Adversarial Modifications:
   - Disassemble the original problem sentence by sentence.
   - Rewrite or rephrase each sentence to integrate adversarial elements that can create fine-grained confusion or introduce subtle traps.
   - Ensure that while the sentences change, the underlying computational logic remains unchanged.

4. Rebuild Context & Structure:
   - Transplant the problem into a new real-world scenario (e.g., replace "bakery sales" with "bookstore inventory") if appropriate.
   - Retain the original problem format (e.g., if the original uses a two-part question, mirror it exactly).
   - Ensure that the new context still embeds the identified pitfalls within new sentences.

5. Embed Pitfalls Strategically:
   - Design each modified sentences to include elements or distractions that may have multiple interpretations or ambiguous meanings to prompt common mistakes or encourage reliance on shortcuts.
   - Consider embedding potential edge cases or misleading hints by carefully selecting synonyms that challenge solvers.

6. Validation Check:
   - Confirm the adversarial problem:
      -- Requires the same mathematical logic as the original.
      -- Contains no contradictions or mismatched values.
      -- Would trick memorization-based solvers but reward conceptual understanding.
      -- The final answer remains {} through valid steps, even with modified sentences.
   - If validation fails, return: Error: Adversarial problem cannot satisfy constraints.

Output Format:

Your final output should be wrapped in the following tags:

Example:
Original Problem:
Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?

Adversarial Problem:
<new_problem>
Josh decides to renovate a house. He purchases it for $80,000 and spends $50,000 on upgrades. These upgrades enhance the home's value by 150% of the original purchase price. What is his total profit?
