Adversarial Math Problem Generator
Objective: Write a new problem that is linguistically different from the original problem, but tests the same core mathematical knowledge, to expose memorization-based problem-solving and tests deep conceptual understanding.

Original Question: {}
Original ground truth: {}
Student's Solution: {}

Steps to Generate Adversarial Problem:

1. Deconstruct the Original Problem:
   - Identify the core mathematical concept (e.g., linear equations, geometry).
   - Map the problem’s logical structure (e.g., sequential steps, dependencies).
   - Identify potential pitfalls or shortcuts that a solver might exploit if they focus only on surface-level cues.

2. Analyze the student's solution:
   - Check the validity of the solution and verify that the reasoning truly understands the core mathematical concepts and steps are naturally leading to the final answer.
   - If the answer is correct, find potential shortcuts or assumptions the student used (e.g., memorized formulas without contextual analysis).
   - If the answer is incorrect, diagnose the root misunderstanding (e.g., misapplying order of operations, misinterpreting units).

3. Adversarial Modifications:
   - The new problem may have modifications on variable names or values, linguistic structures, and scenarios.
   - If there is a variable in original answer like "1-x", the corresponding variable name "x" should not be changed in the new question.
   - Rewrite the problem to integrate adversarial elements that can create fine-grained confusion or introduce subtle traps.
   - Ensure that while the problem change, the underlying computational logic remains unchanged.

4. Rebuild Context & Structure:
   - Transplant the problem into a new real-world scenario (e.g., replace "bakery sales" with "bookstore inventory") if appropriate.
   - Ensure that the new context still embeds the identified pitfalls within new question.

5. Embed Pitfalls Strategically:
   - Design the new problem to include elements or distractions that may have multiple interpretations or ambiguous meanings to prompt common mistakes or encourage reliance on shortcuts.
   - Consider embedding potential edge cases or misleading hints by carefully selecting synonyms that challenge solvers.

6. Validation Check:
   - Confirm the adversarial problem:
      -- Requires the same mathematical logic as the original.
      -- Contains no contradictions or mismatched values.
      -- Would trick memorization-based solvers but reward conceptual understanding.
      -- The final answer remains {} through valid steps, even with linguistic changes.
   - If validation fails, return: Error: Adversarial problem cannot satisfy constraints.

Examples: Here are some examples with new problems proven to be able to expose student's error in mathmatical concept understanding or logical reasoning:

Example 1:
   Original Problem:
      How many 3-letter sequences can be formed if the second letter must be a vowel (A, E, I, O, or U), and the third letter must be different from the first letter?
   Adversarial Problem:
      A 3-symbol license plate is designed where the first symbol must be a vowel (A, E, I, O, U) and the third symbol cannot match the second symbol. How many unique license plates can be created under these rules?

Example 2:
   Original Problem:
      Pick two or fewer different digits from the set 1, 3, 6, 7 and arrange them to form a number.  How many prime numbers can we create in this manner?
   Adversarial Problem:
      A librarian is organizing books labeled with digits 1, 2, 3, 7. Each shelf holds books with either a single unique digit or a pair of distinct digits arranged as a number. How many shelves will contain books whose labels are prime numbers?

Example 3:
   Original Problem:
      If a certain negative number is multiplied by six, the result is the  same as 20 less than the original number.  What is the value of the  original number?
   Adversarial Problem:
      A bank applies a fee that quintuples the negative balance of an account, which is now $16 less than the account's original balance. What was the original balance?

Example 4:
   Original Problem:
      A company pays each of its employees $600 in a month. The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years. If Sylvie just clocked 5 years in the company last December, what's her annual salary after three more years of service?
   Adversarial Problem:
      A nonprofit organization provides a monthly allowance of $600 to volunteers who commit to five years of service. Upon completing five years, volunteers receive an annual increment of 10% of the initial monthly allowance for each subsequent year. If Anita completed her five-year commitment last August, what will her total annual allowance be after three additional years of service?

Example 5:
   Original Problem:
      Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. How load does it take to download the file?
   Adversarial Problem:
      A factory robot is assembling a 400-unit device. Typically, it assembles 4 units/minute. When 40% of the device is built, a calibration error triggers a 20-minute shutdown. After resetting, the robot must restart assembly from scratch. How many minutes does the entire process take?
