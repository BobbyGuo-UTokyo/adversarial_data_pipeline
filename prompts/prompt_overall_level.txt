Adversarial Math Problem Generator
Objective: Write a new problem that is linguistically different from the original problem, but tests the same core mathematical knowledge, to expose memorization-based problem-solving and tests deep conceptual understanding.

Original Question: {}
Original ground truth: {}
Student's Solution: {}

Steps to Generate Adversarial Problem:

1. Deconstruct the Original Problem:
   - Identify the core mathematical concept (e.g., linear equations, geometry).
   - Map the problem’s logical structure (e.g., sequential steps, dependencies).
   - Identify potential pitfalls or shortcuts that a solver might exploit if they focus only on surface-level cues.

2. Analyze the student's solution:
   - Check the validity of the solution and verify that the reasoning truly understands the core mathematical concepts and steps are naturally leading to the final answer.
   - If the answer is correct, find potential shortcuts or assumptions the student used (e.g., memorized formulas without contextual analysis).
   - If the answer is incorrect, diagnose the root misunderstanding (e.g., misapplying order of operations, misinterpreting units).

3. Adversarial Modifications:
   - The new problem may have modifications on variable names or values, linguistic structures, and scenarios.
   - Rewrite the problem to integrate adversarial elements that can create fine-grained confusion or introduce subtle traps.
   - Ensure that while the problem change, the underlying computational logic remains unchanged.

4. Rebuild Context & Structure:
   - Transplant the problem into a new real-world scenario (e.g., replace "bakery sales" with "bookstore inventory") if appropriate.
   - Ensure that the new context still embeds the identified pitfalls within new question.

5. Embed Pitfalls Strategically:
   - Design the new problem to include elements or distractions that may have multiple interpretations or ambiguous meanings to prompt common mistakes or encourage reliance on shortcuts.
   - Consider embedding potential edge cases or misleading hints by carefully selecting synonyms that challenge solvers.

6. Validation Check:
   - Confirm the adversarial problem:
      -- Requires the same mathematical logic as the original.
      -- Contains no contradictions or mismatched values.
      -- Would trick memorization-based solvers but reward conceptual understanding.
      -- The final answer remains {} through valid steps, even with linguistic changes.
   - If validation fails, return: Error: Adversarial problem cannot satisfy constraints.

Output Format:

Your final output should be wrapped in the following tags:

<new_problem>
Insert your generated problem description here.
[Insert adversarially modified problem here. Maintain the original’s structure, including line breaks, punctuation, and numbering.]
</new_problem>

Example:
Original Problem:
If a certain negative number is multiplied by six, the result is the same as 20 less than the original number.  What is the value of the  original number?

Adversarial Problem:
<new_problem>
A city's nighttime temperature becomes five times its original negative value, which makes it 16 degrees colder than the daytime temperature. What was the daytime temperature?
